# AdventOfCode-2017

My solutions written in Python 3.

Personal Challenge: By Day 25 learn Python 3 up to an advanced level, including proper documentation and coding standards.

Note: These solutions aren't meant to have the most efficient 'Big O' time/space complexity, but rather are a means to familiarize myself, and document my progress, with Python 3 as I learn it for the first time.
